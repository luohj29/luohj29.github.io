<p>We’ll assume here that you have a good understanding of Hugo and its structure. If you have any doubt, check the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/" title="Hugo documentation">Hugo documentation</a>; it is pretty good and the community quite active! Thank you so much by the way! :muscle:</p>

<p>The first thing to do when starting your own website is to <strong>copy the content of exampleSite</strong> in your own root folder. This way, you can have a sample of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.toml</code> file and a first structure.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t forget to change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseURL</code> param to avoid deployment failures</strong></p>

<p>Browse the articles in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content/post</code> folder to get any help during setup or using the theme. Please, <a href="https://baptistej.com" title="contact me">contact me</a> if you have any problem using the them.</p>

<p>Then <strong>configure the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.toml</code> file</strong> to match your need.</p>
