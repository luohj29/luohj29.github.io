<p>The archetypes are defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archetypes</code> folder, for both post and portfolio.</p>

<p>The archetypes are defined in YAML, so Front matter is formatted in YAML too. You can easily change them to TOML in your own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archetypes</code> is you wish to.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-YAML">---
title: title
description: desc
date: "2019-05-02T19:47:09+02:00"
---
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code class="language-TOML">+++
title = "title"
description: "desc"
date: "2019-05-02T19:47:09+02:00"
+++
</code></pre>
